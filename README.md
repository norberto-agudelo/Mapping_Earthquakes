Module 13. # Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview 

The purpose of this project is to create interactive maps with earthquakes data from around all the world by using the D3 library as well as GeoJSON to host the geographical information. Furthermore, the leaflet library and the Mapbox API Will be used to populate those geographical maps

A  member from the Disaster Reporting Network team needs to build maps with information about earthquakes on the world. In order to do that he will use the U.S. Geological  Survey website to retrieve data about it by using Java Script, D3 and leaflet libraries

Finally he must plot this data on Mapbox maps. In this Project three different maps (Streets, Satellite and Dark) were built.

On these interactive maps is posible to see all the earthquakes from the seven last days,  the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 as well as the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location.
